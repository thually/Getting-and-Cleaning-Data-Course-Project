# Getting and Cleaning-Data Course Project
This repository corresponds to the one used for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.  

The 'run_analysis.R' file corresponds to a R script with the code required for this last assignment.   

The 'CodeBook.md' file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data that led to the creation of the 'meandata.txt' dataset.  
This codebook is a modification and update of the available codebooks for the original datasets used for the project.
